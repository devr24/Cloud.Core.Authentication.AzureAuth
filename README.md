<div id="description">

Azure specific implementation of `IAuthentication` interface.  Used for injecting Azure bearer authentication into supported packages.

</div>

## Usage

There are four authentication types available.

- Certificate
- User
- Service Principle (App Registration)
- Msi

A bearer token can be generated for each type.  A concrete instance of AzureAuthentication can be created as follows:

```csharp
IAuthentication auth = new AzureAuthentication("<appId>", "<appSecret>", "<tenantId>");
```

This can then be injected into services that expect the `IAuthentication` interface as a dependency, such as a web Api service which needs a bearer token sent with the header of it's requests: 

```csharp
public class ApiServiceSample
{
    private readonly IAuthentication _auth;
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;
    private readonly ILogger<ApiServiceSample> _logger;
    private const int MaxWaitTimeInSeconds = 5;
    private const int MaxRetryTimes = 3;

    public ApiServiceSample(HttpClient httpClient, ILogger<ApiServiceSample> logger, IAuthentication auth)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient;
        _logger = logger;
        _auth = auth; // auth injected.
    }

    public async Task<List<CustomPattern>> GetPatternsAsync()
    {
        var token = _auth.AccessToken;

        // Add auth access token to the header.
        _httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Authorization", "bearer " + token.BearerToken);

        HttpResponseMessage response = null;

        Policy.Handle<TimeoutException>()
            .WaitAndRetryAsync(MaxRetryTimes, retryAttempt => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(MaxWaitTimeInSeconds, retryAttempt))).ExecuteAsync(async () =>
            {
                response = await _httpClient.GetAsync("api/probe");
            }).GetAwaiter().GetResult();
        
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();

        string content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<List<CustomPattern>>(content);
    }
}
```

## Test Coverage
A threshold will be added to this package to ensure the test coverage is above 80% for branches, functions and lines.  If it's not above the required threshold 
(threshold that will be implemented on ALL of the core repositories to gurantee a satisfactory level of testing), then the build will fail.

## Compatibility
This package has has been written in .net Standard and can be therefore be referenced from a .net Core or .net Framework application. The advantage of utilising from a .net Core application, 
is that it can be deployed and run on a number of host operating systems, such as Windows, Linux or OSX.  Unlike referencing from the a .net Framework application, which can only run on 
Windows (or Linux using Mono).
 
## Setup
This package is built using .net Standard 2.1 and requires the .net Core 3.1 SDK, it can be downloaded here:
